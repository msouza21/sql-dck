-- Now continuing the queries training, testing others things of SQL like

-- Aggregations functions, where do operations in set of values 
-- to return unique value, like AVG, SUM, etc.
-- If we want to have a medium of payload capacity of all vehicles,
-- and we can find the maximum and minimum payload capacity 
SELECT MIN(capacity) AS min_capacity, MAX(capacity) AS max_capacity,
ROUND(AVG(capacity),2) AS avg_capacity 
FROM vehicles;

-- Or, and all vehicles with payload capacity more than medium
SELECT id_vehicle, model, capacity FROM vehicles 
WHERE capacity > (SELECT ROUND(AVG(capacity),2)
FROM vehicles)
ORDER BY id_vehicle;

-- More agg functions like:
-- SUM: Sum of values
SELECT SUM(capacity) AS total_capacity FROM vehicles;
-- COUNT: Count of non-null values
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_drivers 
FROM drivers;
-- ARRAY_AGG: Group values into an array, like: [55,20,34]
SELECT ARRAY_AGG(capacity) FROM vehicles;
-- STRING_AGG: Concatenate values into a string with a delimiter
-- like (name,',') where concat the names with ',' delimiter
SELECT STRING_AGG(name, ',') AS names FROM drivers;

--Others...
-- JSON_AGG: Aggregate values into a JSON array
-- BOOL_AND: True if all boolean values are true
-- BOOL_OR: True if any boolean value is true
-- CORR: Correlation between two columns
-- COVAR_POP: Population covariance between two columns
-- COVAR_SAMP: Sample covariance between two columns
-- REGR_SLOPE: Slope of the linear regression
-- REGR_INTERCEPT: Intercept of the linear regression
-- REGR_COUNT: Count of pairs of non-null values
-- REGR_R2: Coefficient of determination (RÂ²) of the regression
-- REGR_AVGX: Average of the x values used in the regression
-- REGR_AVGY: Average of the y values used in the regression


-- Window Functions where can do calcs a set of table rows
-- These functions are applied to a partition of the result set and can return a

-- ROW_NUMBER: Assigns a unique number to each row in a result set, starting at 1
SELECT id_delivery, delivery_date, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY delivery_date)

-- RANK: Assigns a rank to each row within the partition of a result set,

-- NTILE: Divides the result set into a specified number of roughly equal parts and

-- 80 rows in a table and use ntile(4) will be 4 groups of 20 rows with 1 rank for group

-- Using Date functions for like find the number maintenances by month,
-- where TO_CHAR allow extract DATE/TIME for string formated
-- DATE_TRUNC allow reduce the date of YYYY-MM-DD:HH:MM:SS to

-- Views and Materialized Views can be used to create virtual tables to protect acess
-- from original table, where the key diference is that views don't store physically 
-- the data, whilw materialized store, some 2 examples down

-- In this I protect the birth and license infos about the drivers

id_driver, name FROM drivers;

-- Indexes, allowing to place addresses to data for better performance
-- in queries, reducing the time to database to find results
-- having some types like: 
-- B-Tree(standard) where the data is stored in tree ballanced
-- Hash: Key-Value to store pair/equialent data
-- GIN: Data type complex like arrays, JSON and full-text
-- GiST: Data type more complex like geo, polygon and etc
-- BRIN: Data stored sorted blocks sequentially, like logs tables

-- Using now as example Btree and Hash
-- Where creating a example index for status of log route
CREATE INDEX status_route ON 
logs_route(status);

-- Using  Hash to filter exaclty what is asked like using 'WHERE ='
CREATE INDEX status_delivery ON deliveries(status);
